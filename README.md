This was the second big project from Traversy Media's Vanilla JS course. It is a psuedo streaming platform that is designed to gain experience working with APIs, in particular the MovieDB, a public API that contains information on most of the world's movies.

FINAL:

Really stoked on this project. Got a lot of practice working with APIs and was happy with the amount of stuff I was able to figure out on my own. I feel pretty confident with my JavaScript progress going forward, and am really enjoying this course so far.

Most of the code I wrote without the help of the tutorials. That way I was able to compare what I wrote with the tutorial's solution, and make some adjustments if what I did was super ugly. I followed the tutorial for the search functionality and pagination at the end of the project, but still found it to be very beneficial from a learning perspective.

Overall, very happy with this project!
